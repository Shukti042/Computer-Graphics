# Raster Based Graphics Pipeline

In this assignment, I have developed the raster based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can
be thought of as a series of six stages. I have implemented roughly 4 stages of the pipeline.

1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
2. Stage 2: view transformation
3. Stage 3: projection transformation
4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm

My program outputs five files: stage1.txt, stage2.txt, stage3.txt and
z-buffer.txt, out.bmp. The first three files contains the output of the first three stages,
respectively. The fourth file contains z-buffer values (only those which are less than the max value).
And the fifth file is a bmp image generated by the pipeline.
There should be two input files: scene.txt and config.txt
The first file will contain the scene description and second file will contain the necessary information for
the Z-buffer algorithm.

Full description about the tasks are in [Problem Description](https://github.com/Shukti042/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Raster%20Based%20Graphics%20Pipeline/Problem%20Specifications.pdf) file and the solutions are in [Solution](https://github.com/Shukti042/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/Raster%20Based%20Graphics%20Pipeline/Solution).
